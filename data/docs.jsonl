Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae, pneumococcus) is a Gram-positive bacterium, which can cause a variety of diseases including otitis media, nasosinusitis, pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis. To prevent and control pneumococcus diseases, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) were developed and widely implemented worldwide. The introduction of PCVs reduced the infections caused by PCV serotypes, while serotype replacements affected vaccine effectiveness. S. pneumoniae has developed resistance to multiple antibiotics including penicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolone, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. In turn, infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains can affect the treatment of related diseases. Genetic functional studies, molecular detection, and molecular characterization of newly identified mechanisms have been updated in recent years. Hence, this review aims to summarize the serotype distribution, epidemiology and antibiotic resistance mechanism of S. pneumoniae in the vaccine era. A greater understanding of the epidemiological features and antibiotic resistance mechanisms could ultimately assist clinical treatment and prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance strains."}

Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (also known as pneumococci) pose a threat to human health. Pneumococcal infections are the most common cause of milder respiratory tract infections, such as otitis and sinusitis, and of more severe diseases, including pneumonia (with or without septicaemia) and meningitis. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in the childhood vaccination programme in many countries has led to a notable decrease of severe invasive pneumococcal disease in vaccinated children. However, infections caused by non-vaccine types have concurrently increased, causing invasive pneumococcal disease in unvaccinated populations (such as older adults), which has hampered the effect of these vaccines. Moreover, emerging antibiotic resistance is threatening effective therapy. Thus, new approaches are needed for the treatment and prevention of pneumococcal infections, and recent advances in the field may pave the way for new strategies. Recently, several important findings have been gained regarding pneumococcal epidemiology, genomics and the effect of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, elucidative pathogenesis studies have shown that the interactions between pneumococcal virulence factors and host receptors may be exploited for new therapies, and new vaccine candidates have been suggested. In this Review, we summarize some recent findings from clinical disease to basic pathogenesis studies that may be of importance for future control strategies."}

This review is structured to update clinicians on the epidemiology, antibiotic treatment, and prevention of pediatric bacterial pneumonia. The review provides information regarding the current research on antibiotic management for bacterial pneumonia and the newest immunization recommendations to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and other respiratory infections. The recommended length of antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia has been discrepant between low-income and high-income countries. Recently, randomized controlled trials conducted in high-income countries provided evidence to support a short antibiotic course (3-5 days) for uncomplicated bacterial pneumonia in otherwise healthy children. The negative impact of inaccurate penicillin allergy labels in children with pneumonia has emphasized the importance of prompt allergy de-labeling. Newer pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for children and are expected to have a significant impact on bacterial pneumonia rates. Pediatric bacterial pneumonia is an important contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality. A short antibiotic course seems to be sufficient for the outpatient management of uncomplicated bacterial pneumonia; however, more studies are required in the inpatient setting. Future studies will inform the impact of recently introduced pneumococcal and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines on the epidemiology of bacterial pneumonia."}

We conducted a prospective surveillance study of adults aged ≥18 years hospitalized with CAP at 3 hospitals in Tennessee and Georgia between 1 September 2018 and 31 October 2022. We assessed for pneumococcal etiology with cultures, the BinaxNOW urinary antigen detection test, and serotype-specific urinary antigen detection assays that detect 30 pneumococcal serotypes contained in the investigational pneumococcal conjugate vaccine V116, as well as licensed vaccines PCV15 and PCV20 (except serotype 15B).

Isolates from pneumococcal pneumonia have higher resistance rates than those from invasive pneumococcal disease. New antibiotics have been approved for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and are active against multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae . Pneumococcal vaccines in both children and adults are effective in reducing the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, though some circulating vaccine and nonvaccine serotypes are driving antibiotic resistance.

Neutrophils are innate immune cells that are essential for bacterial clearance during pneumococcal pneumonia but can also do harm to host tissue. Neutrophil migration in pneumococcal pneumonia is therefore a major determinant of host disease outcomes. During Spn infection, detection of the bacterium leads to an increase in proinflammatory signals and subsequent expression of integrins and ligands on both the neutrophil as well as endothelial and epithelial cells. These integrins and ligands mediate the tethering and migration of the neutrophil from the bloodstream to the site of infection. A gradient of host-derived and bacterial-derived chemoattractants contribute to targeted movement of neutrophils. During pneumococcal pneumonia, neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the pulmonary space, but studies show that some of the canonical neutrophil migratory machinery is dispensable. Investigation of neutrophil migration is necessary for us to understand the dynamics of pneumococcal infection. Here, we summarize what is known about the pathways that lead to migration of the neutrophil from the capillaries to the lung during pneumococcal infection."}

The gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, otitis media, septicemia, and meningitis in children and adults. Current prevention and treatment efforts are primarily pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that target the bacterial capsule polysaccharide, as well as antibiotics for pathogen clearance. While these methods have been enormously effective at disease prevention and treatment, there has been an emergence of non-vaccine serotypes, termed serotype replacement, and increasing antibiotic resistance among these serotypes. To combat S. pneumoniae, the immune system must deploy an arsenal of antimicrobial functions. However, S. pneumoniae has evolved a repertoire of evasion techniques and is able to modulate the host immune system. Antibodies are a key component of pneumococcal immunity, targeting both the capsule polysaccharide and protein antigens on the surface of the bacterium. These antibodies have been shown to play a variety of roles including increasing opsonophagocytic activity, enzymatic and toxin neutralization, reducing bacterial adherence, and altering bacterial gene expression. In this review, we describe targets of anti-pneumococcal antibodies and describe antibody functions and effectiveness against S. pneumoniae."}

With the notable exceptions of the United States and Canada in particular, the global burden of disease in adults due to invasive infection with the dangerous respiratory, bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains. This situation prevails despite the major successes of inclusion of polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in many national childhood immunization programs and associated herd protection in adults, as well as the availability of effective antimicrobial agents. Accurate assessment of the geographic variations in the prevalence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has, however, been somewhat impeded by the limitations imposed on the acquisition of reliable epidemiological data due to reliance on often insensitive, laboratory-based, pathogen identification procedures. This, in turn, may result in underestimation of the true burden of IPD and represents a primary focus of this review. Other priority topics include the role of PCVs in the changing epidemiology of IPD in adults worldwide, smoking as a risk factor not only in respect of increasing susceptibility for development of IPD, but also in promoting pneumococcal antibiotic resistance. The theme of pneumococcal antibiotic resistance has been expanded to include mechanisms of resistance to commonly used classes of antibiotics, specifically β-lactams, macrolides and fluoroquinolones, and, perhaps somewhat contentiously, the impact of resistance on treatment outcome. Finally, but no less importantly, the role of persistent antigenemia as a driver of a chronic, subclinical, systemic proinflammatory/procoagulant phenotype that may underpin the long-term sequelae and premature mortality of those adults who have recovered from an episode of IPD, is considered."}

Suspected pneumococcal upper respiratory infections and pneumonia are often treated with macrolide antibiotics. Macrolides are bacteriostatic antibiotics and inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. The widespread use of macrolides is associated with increased macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae, and the treatment of pneumococcal infections with macrolides may be associated with clinical failures. In S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistance is due to ribosomal dimethylation by an enzyme encoded by erm(B), efflux by a two-component efflux pump encoded by mef (E)/mel(msr(D)) and, less commonly, mutations of the ribosomal target site of macrolides. A wide array of genetic elements have emerged that facilitate macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae; for example erm(B) is found on Tn917, while the mef (E)/mel operon is carried on the 5.4- or 5.5-kb Mega element. The macrolide resistance determinants, erm(B) and mef (E)/mel, are also found on large composite Tn916-like elements most notably Tn6002, Tn2009, and Tn2010. Introductions of 7-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV-7 and PCV-13) have decreased the incidence of macrolide-resistant invasive pneumococcal disease, but serotype replacement and emergence of macrolide resistance remain an important concern."}

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is characterized by pneumococci invading blood (bacteremia), lungs (pneumonia), or brain and cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis). Meningitis remains an important global health concern because half of the survivors experience long-term neurological damage. The antibiotics commonly used to treat pneumococcal infections are β-lactams and macrolides, however, S. pneumoniae is nowadays often resistant to one or several antibiotics, therefore novel antimicrobials are needed. Here, we found that the bacteriophage-derived cpl-1 endolysin showed consistent antibacterial activity against β-lactam- and macrolide-resistant pneumococcal clinical strains grown in human blood and human cerebrospinal fluid. Exploiting synergistic and additive mechanisms, supplementation of cpl-1 to either penicillin or erythromycin, as representatives for β-lactam and macrolide antibiotics, rescued human neuronal cells from the cytotoxicity of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections. Finally, systemic administration of cpl-1 supplemented to penicillin in mice infected with penicillin-resistant pneumococci successfully reduced bacteremia, and, thanks to the efficient penetration across the blood-brain barrier, abolished bacterial load in the brain, resulting in increased (89%) survival accompanied by an asymptomatic course of infection. These findings strongly suggest that cpl-1 can enhance antibiotic susceptibility in β-lactam- and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, serving as a valuable adjunct therapy to standard-of-care antibiotics for multidrug-resistant IPD."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of community acquired pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some clinical trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in community acquired pneumonia, COVID-19, and ARDS, but the mechanisms of this benefit remain unclear. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of corticosteroids on the pulmonary biology of pneumococcal pneumonia in a mouse model. A secondary objective was to identify shared transcriptomic features of pneumococcal pneumonia and steroid treatment in the mouse model and clinical samples. We carried out comprehensive physiologic, biochemical, and histological analyses in mice to identify the mechanisms of lung injury in Streptococcus pneumoniae with and without adjunctive steroid therapy. We also studied lower respiratory tract gene expression from a cohort of 15 mechanically ventilated patients (10 with Streptococcus pneumoniae and 5 controls) to compare with the transcriptional studies in the mice. In mice with pneumonia, dexamethasone in combination with ceftriaxone reduced (1) pulmonary edema formation, (2) alveolar protein permeability, (3) proinflammatory cytokine release, (4) histopathologic lung injury score, and (5) hypoxemia but did not increase bacterial burden. Transcriptomic analyses identified effects of steroid therapy in mice that were also observed in the clinical samples. In combination with appropriate antibiotic therapy in mice, treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia with steroid therapy reduced hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, lung permeability, and histologic criteria of lung injury, and also altered inflammatory responses at the protein and gene expression level. The transcriptional studies in patients suggest that the mouse model replicates some of the features of pneumonia in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae and steroid treatment. Overall, these studies provide evidence for the mechanisms that may explain the beneficial effects of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with community acquired pneumonia from Streptococcus Pneumoniae."}

A total of 126 clinical pnemococcal strains isolated from unvaccinated children less than 5 years of age with pneumonia at the Nghe An province, Vietnam between Nov 2019 and Mar 2021. All strains were identified using conventional microbiological method, VITEK® 2 Compact system, specific PCR and sequencing. The serotypes and antimicrobial resistance patterns of pnemococcal strains were determined using the multiplex PCR assays and VITEK® 2 Compact system. The results showed that, eight different pneumococcal serotypes were identified. The most common serotypes were 19F (67.46%), followed by 23F (10.32%), 19A (9.52%), 6A/B (3.17%), 15A (2.38%), 9V (3.17%), 11A (1.59%) and 14 (0.80%), respectively. More than half of the pneumococcal strains were non-susceptible to penicillin. The resistance rate to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were 41.3% and 50.8%. The percentage of pneumococci strains resistant to clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, cotrimoxazole, tetracyclin, and clindamycin were more than 93% of all strains.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen causing pneumonia with over 2 million deaths annually, especially in young children and the elderly. To date, at least 98 different pneumococcal capsular serotypes have been identified. Currently, the vaccines for prevention of S. pneumoniae infections are the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-based vaccine (PPV23) and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10 and PCV13). These vaccines only cover some pneumococcal serotypes and are unable to protect against non-vaccine serotypes and unencapsulated S. pneumoniae. This has led to a rapid increase in antibiotic-resistant non-vaccine serotypes. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new, effective, and affordable pneumococcal vaccines, which could cover a wide range of serotypes. This review discusses the new approaches to develop effective vaccines with broad serotype coverage as well as recent development of promising pneumococcal vaccines in clinical trials. New vaccine candidates are the inactivated whole-cell vaccine strain (Δpep27ΔcomD mutant) constructed by mutations of specific genes and several protein-based S. pneumoniae vaccines using conserved pneumococcal antigens, such as lipoprotein and surface-exposed protein (PspA). Among the vaccines in Phase 3 clinical trials are the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, PCV-15 (V114) and 20vPnC.

Severe and recurrent pneumonia are risk factors for chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis; the latter causes considerable morbidity and, in some populations, premature death in children and adults. Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is another chronic endobronchial infection associated with substantial morbidity. In some children, PBB may progress to bronchiectasis. Although nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is the main pathogen in PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis, pneumococci are isolated commonly from the lower airways of children with these diagnoses. Here we review what is known currently about pneumococci in PBB, CSLD and bronchiectasis, including the importance of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization and how persistence in the lower airways may contribute to the pathogenesis of these chronic pulmonary disorders. Antibiotic treatments, particularly long-term azithromycin therapy, are discussed together with antibiotic resistance and the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Important areas requiring further investigation are identified, including immune responses associated with pneumococcal lower airway infection, alone and in combination with other respiratory pathogens, and microarray serotyping to improve detection of carriage and infection by multiple serotypes.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission in early 2020 led to global reductions in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). By contrast, most European countries reported an increase in antibiotic resistance among invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from 2019 to 2020, while an increasing number of studies reported stable pneumococcal carriage prevalence over the same period. To disentangle the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on pneumococcal epidemiology in the community setting, we propose a mathematical model formalizing simultaneous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. To test hypotheses underlying these trends five mechanisms were built into the model and examined: (1) a population-wide reduction of antibiotic prescriptions in the community, (2) lockdown effect on pneumococcal transmission, (3) a reduced risk of developing an IPD due to the absence of common respiratory viruses, (4) community azithromycin use in COVID-19 infected individuals, (5) and a longer carriage duration of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal strains. Among 31 possible pandemic scenarios involving mechanisms individually or in combination, model simulations surprisingly identified only two scenarios that reproduced the reported trends in the general population. They included factors (1), (3), and (4). These scenarios replicated a nearly 50% reduction in annual IPD, and an increase in antibiotic resistance from 20% to 22%, all while maintaining a relatively stable pneumococcal carriage. Exploring further, higher SARS-CoV-2 R0 values and synergistic within-host virus-bacteria interaction mechanisms could have additionally contributed to the observed antibiotic resistance increase.

This was a prospective, population-based, active surveillance study conducted in Goto City, Japan from December 2015 to November 2020. Pneumococcal isolates from sterile sites (blood and pleural fluid) and non-sterile sites (sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage) were cultured as part of the standard of care. S. pneumoniae were serotyped using the Quellung reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using microdilution and interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria. Isolates resistant to erythromycin were phenotyped using the triple-risk test and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. A total of 156 pneumococcal isolates were collected (138 from sputum, 15 from blood, and 3 from bronchoalveolar lavage) from 1992 patients.

Numerous factors explain the limited clinical impact of this major microbiological change. The frequency of intermediate strains is high but the frequency of resistant strains to beta-lactams is very low. There is a complex relation between the acquisition of resistance to beta-lactams and the decreased virulence of S. pneumoniae strains. The only finding in studies of humanized experimental animal models of lethal bacteremic pneumonia caused by resistance and tolerant strains was a slowing in the kinetics of beta-lactams bactericidal activity, especially for amoxicillin. Taken together, this preclinical data shows that microbiological resistance of pneumococci to beta-lactams has very little influence on a possible failure of recommanded treatment regimens for pneumococcal pneumonia. The high rate of multiple drug resistance, particularly among beta-lactam resistant strains, rules out the probabilistic use of macrolides. Conversely, fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance remains low, inferior to 3%, and the same is true for ketolides (<1%).

The resistance patterns have elevated with stepwise increments since then. By the beginning of 2005, approximately 40% of pneumococci were resistant to penicillin and nearly one-fifth of resistant isolates present high-level penicillin resistance. This proves that penicillin is still a good alternative for nonmeningeal infections.

Classes with important resistance problems include the beta-lactams, the macrolides and lincosamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and the tetracyclines. Unfortunately, resistance to more than one class of antibiotics is common in pneumococci, and their treatment is thus becoming more difficult. Patients likely to harbour resistant organisms include young children, particularly those attending day care, older patients, and subjects who have received recent antibiotic therapy, suffer from underlying diseases including HIV, or have nosocomial or polymicrobial pneumonia. The consequences of resistance development are different for different classes of antibiotics. With beta-lactams, the increase in minimal inhibitory concentrations is usually moderate in resistant strains, and because of the high concentrations that can be achieved with this class of drugs resistance does not usually lead to treatment failure. Thus, beta-lactams continue to be important drugs for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, even if the organism is resistant. In contrast, resistance to other classes of antibiotics must be assumed to render these drugs ineffective. Newer quinolones represent valuable alternatives for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, since their efficacy is not affected by resistance to other classes of antibiotics and they cover almost all pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia, including the atypical pathogens.

The aims of the study were as follows: 1) to compare pneumococcal antibiotic resistance patterns in AOM and CAAP in children from central Romania and 2) to compare differences in the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes isolated from the middle ear fluid (MEF) of children with AOM and from the nasopharynx (NP) of children with CAAP. Children younger than 5 years old with AOM or with radiologically confirmed CAAP were prospectively enrolled. Samples from MEF and NP were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility and serotyping. Eighty-eight children with CAAP and 68 with AOM were enrolled. Of the MEF and CAAP isolates, 64 (94.1%) and 79 (89.7%) were penicillin nonsusceptible, respectively. The pneumococcal serotypes distribution in AOM was similar to those in CAAP except for serotype 19F, which was more common in AOM. Overall, 89.7% and 85.8% of all serotypes in AOM and CAAP patients, respectively, were covered by 13-valent PCV. MEF and NP-CAAP S. pneumoniae isolates were similar in regard to serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance. S. pneumoniae antibiotic resistance rates were extremely high. Thirteen-valent PCV has the potential to reduce both the burden of disease as well as the rates of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae in both diseases."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcus, is a Gram-positive diplococcus and a major human pathogen. This bacterium is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, and septicemia, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, studies on S. pneumoniae have mainly focused on the role of its virulence factors including toxins, cell surface proteins, and capsules. However, accumulating evidence indicates that in addition to these studies, knowledge of host factors and host-pathogen interactions is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that neutrophil accumulation, which is generally considered to play a critical role in host defense during bacterial infections, can significantly contribute to lung injury and immune subversion, leading to pneumococcal invasion of the bloodstream. Here, we review bacterial and host factors, focusing on the role of neutrophils and their elastase, which contribute to the progression of pneumococcal pneumonia."}

Pneumococcal pneumonia has high incidence rates and carries a high mortality risk, especially in the elderly. Within the cluster of invasive pneumococcal diseases, pneumonia also represents the most common infectious source. Incidence and mortality rates of both non-invasive and invasive disease have changed as a result of pneumococcal vaccination in children. However, especially elderly patients with comorbidities remain vulnerable to morbidity and mortality caused by pneumococcal disease.

Thrombocytopenic mice (platelet counts < 1% of uninfected controls) showed a reduced survival during pneumococcal pneumonia (27% vs 75% among controls; p = 0.003), which was associated with higher bacterial loads in lungs, spleen, and blood. Thrombocytopenic mice showed enhanced coagulation activation (thrombin-antithrombin complexes) in plasma. Proinflammatory cytokine levels were higher in plasma but not in lungs of thrombocytopenic mice.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major respiratory pathogen, causing 1·2 million deaths and 197 million pneumonia episodes globally in 2016. The spread of S pneumoniae to sterile sites, such as the blood and brain, leads to invasive pneumococcal disease. The best approach available for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in children and, more recently, adults is the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). PCVs are also highly effective at preventing colonisation and, thus, transmission, offering indirect protection to non-target immunisation groups such as adults-a characteristic that has been crucial in their success. However, PCVs only include and protect up to 20 of the 100 serotypes that can cause disease. The rise in adult cases of invasive pneumococcal disease from serotypes included in PCVs suggests indirect protection might be limited. Additionally, non-vaccine serotypes and some vaccine types that persist, some linked to antibiotic resistance, continue to cause disease. Future vaccine strategies include increasing the number of serotypes covered in PCVs for use in children and adults, broader vaccine use in adults, the development of adult-specific conjugate vaccines containing serotypes different from those covered in PCVs used in children, and protein vaccines, all of which will be explored in this Review. These strategies are expected to help mitigate the global burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in future years."}

In this study, we compared an isogenic deletion strain of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 in polyamine transport operon (ΔpotABCD) with the wild type in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia. Our results show that the wild type persists in mouse lung 24 h post infection while the mutant strain is cleared by host defense mechanisms. We show that intact potABCD is required for survival in the host by providing resistance to neutrophil killing. Comparative proteomics analysis of murine lungs infected with wild type and ΔpotABCD pneumococci identified expression of proteins that could confer protection to wild type strain and help establish infection.

To understand the burden and epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae disease among children between 1 and 59 months of age in China, we conducted a review of literature published between 1980 and 2008 applying standardized algorithms. Because of the absence of population-based surveillance for pneumococcal disease (PD), we identified all-cause pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis burden, syndromes most commonly associated with S. pneumoniae, and applied the proportion of disease attributable to S. pneumoniae from studies that determined the etiology of these three syndromes to calculate PD burden. Because of the microbiologic difficulties in identifying S. pneumoniae-attributable pneumonia which likely underestimates the pneumonia burden, we also used the proportion obtained from vaccine efficacy trials. Between 1980 and 2008, there were 12,815 cases/100,000/year of all-cause pneumonia among children between 1 month and 59 months, with 526 deaths/100,000 annually. There were 14 meningitis cases/100,000/year. We estimate that as of 2000, there were 260,768 (113,000 to 582,382) and 902 (114-4,463) cases of pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis, respectively with 10,703 (4,638-23,904) and 75 (9-370) pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis deaths, respectively.

Background:Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen causing death in children under 5 years old. This retrospective surveillance aimed to analyze serotype distribution, drug resistance, virulence factors, and molecular characteristics of pneumonia isolates from children in Shanghai, China. Methods: A total of 287 clinical pneumococcal isolates were collected from January to December in 2018 and were divided into community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) two groups according to where someone contracts the infection. All isolates were serotyped by multiplex sequential PCR and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using E-test or disk diffusion method. The molecular epidemiology was analyzed using multilocus sequence typing and seven housekeeping genes were sequenced to identified the sequence types (STs). In addition, we investigated the presence of virulence genes via PCR. Results: The most common serotypes were 19F, 6A, 19A, 23F, 14, and 6B, and the coverage rates of the 7-, 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were 58.9, 58.9, and 80.5%, respectively. More PCV13/non-PCV7 serotypes and higher rate of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae were seen in HAP. Molecular epidemiological typing showed a high level of diversity and five international antibiotic-resistant clones were found, including Taiwan19F-14, Spain23F-1, Spain6B-2, Taiwan23F-15 and Sweden15A-25. No significant difference was observed in the presence of virulence genes among the isolates obtained from CAP and HAP. All of the S. pneumoniae isolates carried lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP, and the carriage rate of nanA and piaA were 96.2 and 99.0%. Conversely, cps2A, cbpA, and pspA were present in 33.8-44.3% of the isolates. Conclusions: Serotype changes and emerging multidrug-resistant international clones were found in current study. lytA, ply, psaA, pavA, spxB, htrA, and clpP may be good protein vaccine candidates.

Median colonization density among 56 cases with MCPP (MCPP cases; 17.28 × 106 copies/mL) exceeded that of cases without MCPP (non-MCPP cases; 0.75 × 106) and controls (0.60 × 106) (each P < .001). The optimal density for discriminating MCPP cases from controls using the Youden index was >6.9 log10 copies/mL; overall, the sensitivity was 64% and the specificity 92%, with variable performance by site.

Available data favor the use of a macrolide together with a β-lactam antibiotic for treatment, based largely on immunomodulatory activity of macrolides. Two large subgroup analyses from a single major study suggest that activated protein C (eg, drotrecogin) should be considered for patients with severe sepsis, organ failure, and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score > 25 due to pneumococcal pneumonia. Statins exert an anti-inflammatory effect and several retrospective studies suggest that their use might ameliorate the adverse effects of pneumonia. Because inflammation elsewhere in the body is associated with inflammation in coronary arteries and because pneumococcal pneumonia has been shown to precipitate myocardial infarction, statins might be of further benefit by decreasing the likelihood of associated myocardial infarction. Aspirin, which inhibits platelet aggregation in inflamed coronary arteries, might also be considered for initial therapy. One reason that the association between myocardial infarction and pneumonia was not previously recognized is that aspirin was widely used in the past when people had acute febrile conditions.

Predicting the outcome of vaccination requires knowing what drives selection for drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and what maintains the circulation of both antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. To address this question, we used mathematical modeling and data from 2007 on penicillin consumption and penicillin nonsusceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) invasive isolates from 27 European countries. We show that the frequency of penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae can be explained by between-host diversity in antibiotic use, heritable diversity in pneumococcal carriage duration, or frequency-dependent selection brought about by within-host competition between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive S. pneumoniae strains. We used our calibrated models to predict the impact of non-serotype-specific pneumococcal vaccination upon the prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage, incidence of disease, and frequency of S. pneumoniae antibiotic resistance. We found that the relative strength and directionality of competition between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive pneumococcal strains was the most important determinant of whether vaccination would promote, inhibit, or have little effect upon the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Last, we show that country-specific differences in pathogen transmission substantially altered the predicted impact of vaccination, highlighting that policies for managing antibiotic resistance with vaccines must be tailored to a specific pathogen and setting."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae inflicts a huge disease burden as the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis. Soon after mainstream antibiotic usage, multiresistant pneumococcal clones emerged and disseminated worldwide. Resistant clones are generated through adaptation to antibiotic pressures imposed while naturally residing within the human upper respiratory tract. Here, a huge array of related commensal streptococcal strains transfers core genomic and accessory resistance determinants to the highly transformable pneumococcus. β-Lactam resistance is the hallmark of pneumococcal adaptability, requiring multiple independent recombination events that are traceable to nonpneumococcal origins and stably perpetuated in multiresistant clonal complexes. Pneumococcal strains with elevated MICs of β-lactams are most often resistant to additional antibiotics. Basic underlying mechanisms of most pneumococcal resistances have been identified, although new insights that increase our understanding are continually provided. Although all pneumococcal infections can be successfully treated with antibiotics, the available choices are limited for some strains. Invasive pneumococcal disease data compiled during 1998 to 2013 through the population-based Active Bacterial Core surveillance program (U.S. population base of 30,600,000) demonstrate that targeting prevalent capsular serotypes with conjugate vaccines (7-valent and 13-valent vaccines implemented in 2000 and 2010, respectively) is extremely effective in reducing resistant infections. Nonetheless, resistant non-vaccine-serotype clones continue to emerge and expand."}

Although vaccines have effectively reduced disease worldwide, data on adult serotype distribution and resistance in China are scarce. This study investigates serotype patterns and antimicrobial susceptibility of S. pneumoniae among Chinese adults. We collected a total of 474 S. pneumoniae isolates from adult patients diagnosed with pneumococcal infections in 14 cities across five geographic regions of China between 2018 and 2019. Clinical specimens included sputum, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pharyngeal and nasal swabs, and middle ear fluid. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobial agents were determined using the agar dilution method. Pneumococcal serotyping was performed using the Pneumotest-Latex kit and type-specific antisera. Serotype 19F was the most prevalent across all age groups, specimen types, and regions. 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) is expected to provide the highest serotype coverage (69.4%) among all vaccines evaluated. Multidrug resistance was detected in over 94% of isolates, with high resistance to macrolides, tetracycline, and clindamycin. β-lactam resistance varied by syndrome and region. Non-invasive isolates showed slightly higher resistance than invasive ones. Serotypes covered by higher-valency vaccines were more likely to be antibiotic-resistant, although fluoroquinolone and vancomycin resistance remained low. Our findings highlight a high burden of antimicrobial resistance and predominance of specific serotypes, particularly 19F, among adult S. pneumoniae isolates in China. The broad serotype coverage of PCV20 suggests its potential advantage in future adult immunization strategies. Continued surveillance of serotype distribution and resistance patterns is essential to inform vaccine policy and guide effective antibiotic use."}

Prevention of the first acquisition of Streptococcus pneumoniae through the use of vaccines represents an effective method to reduce the burden of the disease in both children and adults. Two vaccines are currently available in adults: a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) that includes 23 purified capsular polysaccharide antigens and a pneumococcal protein-conjugate vaccine (PCV13) that includes capsular polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to a non-toxic protein. The PPV23 induces a humoral immune response and since it has been licensed has been the subject of debates and controversies. Numerous studies and meta-analyses have shown that PPV23 protects against invasive pneumococcal disease, although there are conflicting data regarding its efficacy for the prevention of pneumonia. Vaccination with PCV13 stimulates good antibody responses as well as mucosal immunity and suppresses colonization. A conjugate vaccine can be expected to have benefits over a polysaccharide vaccine because of the characteristics of a T-cell-dependent response in terms of affinity, maturation of antibodies with repeated exposure, induction of immunological memory and long-lasting immunity. PCV13 has demonstrated all of these characteristics in children and fundamental differences in adults are not expected.

Over the past two decades, traditional antimicrobial strategies have lost efficacy due to a rapid rise in antibiotic resistance and limited success in developing new antibiotics. Rather than relying on therapeutics solely targeting the bacterial pathogen, therapies are emerging that simultaneously focus on host responses. Here, we describe the most promising 'host-informed therapies' (HITs) in two categories: those that aid patients with fully functional immune systems, and those that aid patients with perturbed immune processes. Using Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, as a case study, we show HITs as an attractive option for supplementing infection management. However, to broaden their applicability and design new strategies, targeted research and clinical trials will be essential."}

Emerging antibiotic resistance has been a concern because of its potential negative impact on the outcome of patients who receive standard antibiotic therapy. However, there have been substantial changes in the epidemiology of this pathogen in recent years, not least of which has been due to the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children, with subsequent herd protection in unvaccinated adults and children. Furthermore, much recent research has led to a better understanding of the virulence factors of this pathogen and their role in the pathogenesis of severe pneumococcal disease, including the cardiac complications, as well as the potential role of adjunctive therapy in the management of severely ill cases.

Intraspecies and interspecies interactions influence pneumococcal carriage in important ways. Co-colonization by two or more pneumococcal strains has implications for vaccine serotype replacement, carriage detection, and pneumonia diagnostics.

The PCV7 serotypes decreased significantly among the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia from 46.4% in 2011 to 20.0% in 2013 (p < 0.05). Conversely, PCV13 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (PPSV23) serotypes other than PCV7 serotypes mildly increased during this period. In addition, the frequency of serotypes 19F, 23F and 4 (which are covered by PCV7) decreased annually; however, the changes in the frequencies of the other serotypes were not significant. This study demonstrated the yearly decrease of PCV7 serotypes in adult pneumococcal pneumonia patients after introducing PCV7 into the childhood immunization schedule in Japan.

Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the most common serious infections in children, with an annual incidence of 34 to 40 cases per 1,000 children in Europe and North America. When diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia, physicians should rely mainly on the patient's history and physical examination, supplemented by judicious use of chest radiographs and laboratory tests as needed. The child's age is important in making the diagnosis. Pneumonia in neonates younger than three weeks of age most often is caused by an infection obtained from the mother at birth. Streptococcus pneumoniae and viruses are the most common causes in infants three weeks to three months of age. Viruses are the most frequent cause of pneumonia in preschool-aged children; Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial pathogen. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae often are the etiologic agents in children older than five years and in adolescents. In very young children who appear toxic, hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics are needed. The symptoms in outpatients who present with community-acquired pneumonia can help determine the treatment. Knowing the age-specific causes of bacterial pneumonia will help guide antibiotic therapy.

Thus, based on current levels of resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin, most patients with mild/moderate pneumococcal pneumonia may respond to oral amoxicillin, and most with severe pneumonia may be successfully treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. It is of concern that patients infected with erythromycin-resistant pneumococci may not respond to therapy with a macrolide. In our opinion, except for well-selected patients, imipenem and vancomycin should not be widely used for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia.

The present study assessed the antimicrobial potential of a plant extract, 220D-F2, rich in ellagic acid, and ellagic acid derivatives, against S. pneumoniae planktonic cells and biofilm structures. Our studies first demonstrate that, when inoculated together with planktonic cultures, 220D-F2 inhibited the formation of pneumococcal biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. As measured by bacterial counts and a LIVE/DEAD bacterial viability assay, 100 and 200 µg/ml of 220D-F2 had significant bactericidal activity against pneumococcal planktonic cultures as early as 3 h post-inoculation. Quantitative MIC's, whether quantified by qPCR or dilution and plating, showed that 80 µg/ml of 220D-F2 completely eradicated overnight cultures of planktonic pneumococci, including antibiotic resistant strains. When preformed pneumococcal biofilms were challenged with 220D-F2, it significantly reduced the population of biofilms 3 h post-inoculation. Minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC)50 was obtained incubating biofilms with 100 µg/ml of 220D-F2 for 3 h and 6 h of incubation. 220D-F2 also significantly reduced the population of pneumococcal biofilms formed on human pharyngeal cells.

According to blood and sputum culture and urine ICT, the test sensitivity in 59 patients with a pneumococcal aetiology was 81%. The specificity was suboptimal, with 72% negative tests among CAP patients without a pneumococcal aetiology. However, the test was positive in only 11% of patients with atypical pneumonia and in 4.7% of healthy controls. The positivity rate was higher for NPA ICT compared to culture on NPA in all CAP patients, and to both PCR and culture on NPA in non-pneumococcal non-atypical CAP patients. In 113 (63%) patients with β-lactam monotherapy, cure without treatment alteration was noted more often in cases with positive compared to negative NPA ICT at admission (91% vs 69%; p < 0.01). The high sensitivity and the low positivity rates in patients with atypical pneumonia and healthy controls, in combination with the correlation between positive test results and clinical cure with β-lactam therapy, may support a pneumococcal aetiology in CAP in populations with low pneumococcal carriage rates."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of both pneumonia overall and fatal pneumonia. Antibiotic resistance has developed worldwide and is most frequent in pneumococcal serotypes that are most prevalent in children (types/groups 6, 14, 19, and 23). The incidence of pneumococcal disease is the highest in children < 2 years of age and in adults > 65 years of age. Other important risk factors are chronic heart and lung disease, cigarette smoking, and asplenia. A 23-valent capsular polysaccharide vaccine and a heptavalent protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine are currently available. The latter is specially designed for pediatric use because small children respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. Both vaccines are efficacious in prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease. The clinical presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia is variable, and neither clinical features nor laboratory or radiographic findings can reliably predict the etiology of pneumonia. Blood culture is the most important tool for establishing a definitive diagnosis, but Gram's stains and sputum culture are also of value in skilled hands. A recently developed urinary antigen test may provide a rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Penicillin (penicillin G/amoxicillin) remains the drug of choice for strains that are fully sensitive or have a moderately decreased susceptibility to penicillin, whereas cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are the first-line alternatives in cases with higher levels of resistance."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae were retrospectively collected from health asymptomatic participants and CAP patients in Sichuan, China. The serotypes were tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or Quellung reaction. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution method. The molecular epidemiology of S. pneumoniae was analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Additionally, the presence of virulence/pili genes were detected using PCR.

Active surveillance from 2006 to 2011 identified acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI)-related hospital admissions. Adult cases of pneumococcal pneumonia were defined as hospitalized ALRI patients aged ≥ 18 years with isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood or with positive UAT. Among 39,525 adult ALRI patients, we identified 481 pneumococcal pneumonia cases (105 by blood culture, 376 by UAT only). Estimated incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations was 30.5 cases per 100,000 persons per year (2.2 and 28.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year by blood culture and UAT, respectively).

Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a human respiratory tract pathogen and a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Although the pneumococcus is a commensal bacterium that colonizes the nasopharynx, it also causes lethal diseases such as meningitis, sepsis, and pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised patients, in the elderly, and in young children. Due to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and the emergence of nonvaccine serotypes, the pneumococcus has been classified as one of the priority pathogens for which new antibacterials are urgently required by the World Health Organization, 2017. Understanding molecular mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections and bacterial interactions within the host is crucial to developing novel therapeutics. Previously considered to be an extracellular pathogen, it is becoming evident that pneumococci may also occasionally establish intracellular niches within the body to escape immune surveillance and spread within the host. Intracellular survival within host cells also enables pneumococci to resist many antibiotics. Within the host cell, the bacteria exist in unique vacuoles, thereby avoiding degradation by the acidic lysosomes, and modulate the expression of its virulence genes to adapt to the intracellular environment. To invade and survive intracellularly, the pneumococcus utilizes a combination of virulence factors such as pneumolysin (PLY), pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), pneumococcal adhesion and virulence protein B (PavB), the pilus-1 adhesin RrgA, pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), and metalloprotease (ZmpB).

All adult patients admitted to Dijon Hospital (France) from 2005 to 2013 who had BPP without complications, and were alive on the third day were enrolled. Clinical, biological, radiological, microbiological and therapeutic data were recorded. A first analysis was conducted to assess factors associated with being on amoxicillin on the third day. A second analysis, adjusting for a propensity score, was performed to determine whether 30-day mortality was associated with streamlining to amoxicillin monotherapy. Of the 196 patients hospitalized for BPP, 161 were still alive on the third day and were included in the study. Treatment was streamlined to amoxicillin in 60 patients (37%). Factors associated with not streamlining were severe pneumonia (OR 3.11, 95%CI [1.23-7.87]) and a first-line antibiotic combination (OR 3.08, 95%CI [1.34-7.09]). By contrast, starting with amoxicillin monotherapy correlated inversely with the risk of subsequent treatment with antibiotics other than amoxicillin (OR 0.06, 95%CI [0.01-0.30]). The Cox model adjusted for the propensity-score analysis showed that streamlining to amoxicillin during BPP was not significantly associated with a higher risk of 30-day mortality (HR 0.38, 95%CI [0.08-1.87]).

Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of death worldwide. A growing body of evidence indicates that the successful treatment of bacterial infections results from synergy between antibiotic-mediated direct antibacterial activity and the host's immune defenses. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective immune responses induced by amoxicillin, a β-lactam antibiotic used as the first-line treatment of S. pneumoniae infections, have not been characterized. A better understanding of amoxicillin's effects on host-pathogen interactions might facilitate the development of other treatment options. Given the crucial role of neutrophils in the control of S. pneumoniae infections, we decided to investigate amoxicillin's impact on neutrophil development in a mouse model of pneumococcal superinfection. A single therapeutic dose of amoxicillin almost completely eradicated the bacteria and prevented local and systemic inflammatory responses. Interestingly, in this context, amoxicillin treatment did not impair the emergency granulopoiesis triggered in the bone marrow by S. pneumoniae. Importantly, treatment of pneumonia with amoxicillin was associated with a greater mature neutrophil count in the bone marrow; these neutrophils had specific transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. Furthermore, amoxicillin-conditioned, mature neutrophils in the bone marrow had a less activated phenotype and might be rapidly mobilized in peripheral tissues in response to systemic inflammation. Thus, by revealing a novel effect of amoxicillin on the development and functions of bone marrow neutrophils during S. pneumoniae pneumonia, our findings provide new insights into the impact of amoxicillin treatment on host immune responses."}

However, complete bacterial eradication from lung tissue was achieved only in the CRO + AZM + MP group. Secondary outcomes, including bacterial burden in tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, showed similar bactericidal activity across all treatment groups. The CRO + AZM + MP group demonstrated the most controlled inflammatory response, achieving baseline levels of inflammation, while other groups exhibited elevated inflammatory markers.

The microbial aetiology is diverse and influenced by preexisting disease, seasonality, as well as animate and inanimate environmental sources; pneumococci, Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and more recently Chlamydia pneumoniae are the predominant bacterial pathogens. Gram-negative enteric bacteria although less common are particularly virulent. Antibiotic resistance is well established for Haemophilus influenzae and Gram-negative bacillary infections, but has been a recent phenomenon in the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is numerically the leading pathogen. Despite the concerns raised by this reduced susceptibility to penicillin, evidence that this has been translated into increased clinical failures is currently difficult to establish. Macrolide and tetracycline resistance among pneumococci is more common. beta-Lactamase production by H. influenzae has now reached levels where, in those with severe pneumonia, beta-lactamase stable agents are preferred. Consensus Guidelines on the treatment of community acquired pneumonia have been published by the British Thoracic Society, the American Thoracic Society, and from Expert Panels in Canada and France. These emphasize severity assessment and differentiate management in the community or hospital setting. The recommended regimens are compared and contrasted. In conclusion, mild/moderate pneumonia, when pneumococcal in nature, is likely to still respond to amoxycillin or penicillin G, but in higher dosages where pneumococcal resistance is documented. However, in severe infection where pneumococcal resistance, other beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, or an atypical infection could be operating, it is important that initial empirical therapy be broad spectrum and promptly administered. Treating multiresistant pneumococcal disease in those allergic to beta-lactams presents a particular dilemma. Glycopeptides are currently preferred."}

Pneumonia is a pulmonary disease affecting people of all ages and is consistently a leading cause of childhood mortality and adult hospitalizations. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major lung pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. Additionally, mixed lung infections involving these bacterial pathogens are increasing in prevalence and are frequently more severe than single infections. The cooperative interactions of these two pathogens that impact pulmonary disease severity are understudied. A major secreted virulence factor of P. aeruginosa, protease IV (PIV), cleaves interleukin 22 (IL-22), a cytokine essential for maintaining innate mucosal defenses against extracellular pathogens. Here, we investigate the ability of PIV to augment the virulence of a pneumococcal strain with limited virulence, S. pneumoniae EF3030, in a C57BL/6 murine model of pneumonia. We demonstrate that pulmonary coinfection involving P. aeruginosa 103-29 and S. pneumoniae EF3030 results in pneumococcal bacteremia that is abrogated during pneumococcal coinfection with a PIV-deficient strain. Furthermore, intratracheal administration of exogenous PIV and EF3030 resulted in abundant immune cell infiltration into the lung with large abscess formation, as well as severe bacteremia leading to 100% mortality. Heat-inactivated PIV did not worsen pneumonia or reliably induce bacteremia, suggesting that the specific activity of PIV is required. Our studies also show that PIV depletes IL-22 in vivo Moreover, PIV-mediated enhancement of pneumonia and disease severity was dependent on the expression of pneumolysin (Ply), a prominent virulence factor of S. pneumoniae Altogether, we reveal that PIV and Ply additively potentiate pneumonia in a murine model of lung infection.IMPORTANCES. pneumoniae remains the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia despite widespread use of pneumococcal vaccines, forcing the necessity for appropriate treatment to control pneumococcal infections. Coinfections involving S. pneumoniae with other bacterial pathogens threaten antibiotic treatment strategies and disease outcomes. Currently, there is not an effective treatment for alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction that precedes bacteremia. An understanding of the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions during single and mixed pulmonary infections could elucidate proper treatment strategies needed to prevent or reduce invasive disease. Antibiotic treatment decreases bacterial burden in the lung but also increases acute pathology due to cytotoxins released via antibiotic-induced bacterial lysis. Therefore, targeted therapeutics that inhibit or counteract the effects of bacterial proteases and toxins are needed in order to limit pathology and disease progression. This study identifies the cooperative effect of PIV and Ply, products of separate lung pathogens that additively alter the lung environment and facilitate invasive disease."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of community acquired pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of corticosteroids on the pulmonary biology of pneumococcal pneumonia in an observational cohort of mechanically ventilated patients and in a mouse model of bacterial pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae. We studied gene expression with lower respiratory tract transcriptomes from a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients and in mice. We also carried out comprehensive physiologic, biochemical, and histological analyses in mice to identify the mechanisms of lung injury in Streptococcus pneumoniae with and without adjunctive steroid therapy. Transcriptomic analysis identified pleiotropic effects of steroid therapy on the lower respiratory tract in critically ill patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, findings that were reproducible in mice. In mice with pneumonia, dexamethasone in combination with ceftriaxone reduced (1) pulmonary edema formation, (2) alveolar protein permeability, (3) proinflammatory cytokine release, (4) histopathologic lung injury score, and (5) hypoxemia but did not increase bacterial burden. The gene expression studies in patients and in the mice support the clinical relevance of the mouse studies, which replicate several features of pneumococcal pneumonia and steroid therapy in humans. In combination with appropriate antibiotic therapy in mice, treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia with steroid therapy reduced hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, lung permeability, and histologic criteria of lung injury, and also altered inflammatory responses at the protein and gene expression level.

It has been estimated that for every bacteremic pneumonia that is documented, three non-bacteremic infections occur. Management of these infections is potentially complicated by the increasing resistance of the isolates to the commonly used antibiotics.

Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract constitute a major cause of death worldwide. Given the constant rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, treatment failure is increasingly frequent. In this context, innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Stimulation of innate immune cells in the respiratory tract [via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)] is an attractive approach for rapidly activating the body's immune defenses against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Previous studies of the TLR5 agonist flagellin in animal models showed that standalone TLR stimulation does not result in the effective treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infection but does significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of concomitant antibiotic treatment. Here, we investigated the antibacterial interaction between antibiotic and intranasal flagellin in a mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection. Using various doses of orally administered amoxicillin or systemically administered cotrimoxazole, we found that the intranasal instillation of flagellin (a dose that promotes maximal lung pro-inflammatory responses) induces synergistic rather than additive antibacterial effects against antibiotic-susceptible pneumococcus. We next set up a model of infection with pneumococcus that is resistant to multiple antibiotics in the context of influenza superinfection. Remarkably, the combination of amoxicillin and flagellin effectively treated superinfection with the amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcus since the bacterial clearance was increased by more than 100-fold compared to standalone treatments. Our results also showed that, in response to flagellin, the lung tissue generated an innate immune response even though it had been damaged by the influenza virus and pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the selective boosting of lung innate immunity is a conceptually advantageous approach for improving the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment and fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria."}

Neutrophils are the first leukocytes to be recruited to sites of inflammation in response to chemotactic factors released by activated macrophages and pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells in bacterial pneumonia, a common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although neutrophilic inflammation facilitates the elimination of pathogens, neutrophils also may cause bystander tissue injury. Even though the presence of neutrophils in alveolar spaces is a key feature of acute lung injury and ARDS especially from pneumonia, their contribution to the pathogenesis of lung injury is uncertain. The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of neutrophils in a clinically relevant model of bacterial pneumonia. We investigated the effect of reducing neutrophils in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia treated with antibiotics. Neutrophils were reduced with anti-lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly6G) monoclonal antibody 24 h before and immediately preceding infection. Mice were inoculated intranasally with Streptococcus pneumoniae and received ceftriaxone 12 h after bacterial inoculation. Neutrophil reduction in mice treated with ceftriaxone attenuated hypoxemia, alveolar permeability, epithelial injury, pulmonary edema, and inflammatory biomarker release induced by bacterial pneumonia, even though bacterial loads in the distal air spaces of the lung were modestly increased as compared with antibiotic treatment alone.

Biofilm formation by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with colonization of the upper respiratory tract, including the carrier state, and with chronic respiratory infections in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The use of antibiotics alone to treat recalcitrant infections caused by biofilms is insufficient in many cases, requiring novel strategies based on a combination of antibiotics with other agents, including antibodies, enzybiotics, and antioxidants. In this work, we demonstrate that the third-generation oral cephalosporin cefditoren (CDN) and the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) are synergistic against pneumococcal biofilms. Additionally, the combination of CDN and NAC resulted in the inhibition of bacterial growth (planktonic and biofilm cells) and destruction of the biofilm biomass. This marked antimicrobial effect was also observed in terms of viability in both inhibition (prevention) and disaggregation (treatment) assays. Moreover, the use of CDN and NAC reduced bacterial adhesion to human lung epithelial cells, confirming that this strategy of combining these two compounds is effective against resistant pneumococcal strains colonizing the lung epithelium. Finally, administration of CDN and NAC in mice suffering acute pneumococcal pneumonia caused by a multidrug-resistant strain was effective in clearing the bacteria from the respiratory tract in comparison to treatment with either compound alone. Overall, these results demonstrate that the combination of oral cephalosporins and antioxidants, such as CDN and NAC, respectively, is a promising strategy against respiratory biofilms caused by S. pneumoniae. IMPORTANCE Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the deadliest bacterial pathogens, accounting for up to 2 million deaths annually prior to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vaccines have decreased the burden of diseases produced by S. pneumoniae, but the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains and nonvaccine serotypes is worrisome. Pneumococcal biofilms are associated with chronic respiratory infections, and treatment is challenging, making the search for new antibiofilm therapies a priority as biofilms become resistant to traditional antibiotics. In this work, we used the combination of an antibiotic (CDN) and an antioxidant (NAC) to treat the pneumococcal biofilms of relevant clinical isolates. We demonstrated a synergy between CDN and NAC that inhibited and treated pneumococcal biofilms, impaired pneumococcal adherence to the lung epithelium, and treated pneumonia in a mouse pneumonia model.

Streptococcus pneumoniae can asymptomatically colonize the nasopharynx and cause a diverse range of illnesses. This clinical spectrum from colonization to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) appears to depend on the pneumococcal capsular serotype rather than the genetic background. According to a literature review, serotypes 1, 4, 5, 7F, 8, 12F, 14, 18C, and 19A are more likely to cause IPD. Although serotypes 1 and 19A are the predominant causes of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, serotype 14 remains one of the most common etiologic agents of non-bacteremic pneumonia in adults, even after 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduction. Serotypes 1, 3, and 19A pneumococci are likely to cause empyema and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Serotype 1 pneumococcal meningitis is prevalent in the African meningitis belt, with a high fatality rate. In contrast to the capsule type, genotype is more closely associated with antibiotic resistance. CC320/271 strains expressing serotype 19A are multidrug-resistant (MDR) and prevalent worldwide in the era of PCV7. Several clones of MDR serotype 6C pneumococci emerged, and a MDR 6D clone (ST282) has been identified in Korea. Since the pneumococcal epidemiology of capsule types varies geographically and temporally, a nationwide serosurveillance system is vital to establishing appropriate vaccination strategies for each country."}

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a disease that frequently affects children and adults throughout the world. As it places a considerable burden on society and, particularly, healthcare resources, any means of reducing its incidence and impact arouses great interest. A substantial number of paediatric and adult CAP cases are due to Streptococcus pneumoniae but, fortunately, there are effective vaccines available that are likely to have a significant impact on CAP-related medical, social and economic problems. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the published evidence concerning the impact of pneumococcal vaccines on CAP in children and adults. The original 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) completely modified the total burden of pneumococcal diseases in vaccinated children and unvaccinated contacts of any age. However, the existence of some problems moderately reducing its preventive efficacy has led to the development of PCVs with a larger number of pneumococcal serotypes, including those that were previously of marginal importance but now cause of severe disease. It is reasonable to think that these PCVs (particularly PCV13, which includes all of the most important serotypes emerging since the introduction of PCV7) will further reduce the importance of pneumococcal diseases, although it is still not clear whether the replacement of the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine with PCV13 would be more protective in adults."}

All these are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pneumococcus can colonize the nasopharynx, and this can be a prelude to bronchopneumonia and invasion of the vasculature space. Proliferation in the blood can result in a breach of the blood-brain barrier and entry into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where the bacteria cause inflammation of the meningeal membranes resulting in meningitis. The infected host may develop septicaemia and/or meningitis secondary to bronchopneumonia. Also septicaemia is a common precursor of meningitis. The mechanisms surrounding the sequence of infection are unknown, but will be dependent on the properties of both the host and bacterium. Treatment of these diseases with antibiotics leads to clearance of the bacteria from the infected tissues, but the bacteriolytic nature of antibiotics leads to an acute release of bacterial toxins and thus after antibiotic therapy the patients can be left with organ-specific deficits. One of the main toxins released from pneumococci is the membrane pore forming toxin pneumolysin. Here we review the extensive studies on the role of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases."}

This study was conducted to determine the effect of a nonavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-9) on the carriage of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci in the DCC. Healthy DCC attendees ages 12 to 35 months were randomized to receive either PCV-9 or a control vaccine (conjugate meningococcus C vaccine) in a double blinded manner. Nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae cultures were obtained from each subject before vaccination, monthly during the first year of follow-up and every 2 to 3 months during the second year of follow-up. For each isolate the serotype and antibiotic susceptibility were determined. A total of 132 and 130 evaluable toddlers received either PCV-9 or the control vaccine, respectively. In total 3748 cultures were obtained, of which 2450 (65%) were positive for S. pneumoniae. The resistance rates to penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin were 36, 35 and 16%, respectively. Resistance rates to > or =1 and > or =3 antibiotic categories were 52 and 9%, respectively. Antibiotic resistance was found mainly in the 5 serotypes included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (6B, 9V, 14, 19F and 23F) and in 2 related serotypes (6A and 19A). In the vaccinated group a clear and significant reduction of the carriage rate of the serotypes included in the vaccine and the related serotype 6A as well as an increase in the carriage rate of the serotypes not included in the vaccine were observed. In parallel a significant decrease in carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci was observed. The reduction of carriage of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci was seen in all age windows but was greater in the age window <36 months. The carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae, including multiply resistant S. pneumoniae, in DCC attendees is high. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines seem to be an important tool for reducing the carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant pneumonia in DCCs."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, causes severe invasive infections, including meningitis and bacteremia. The widespread use of macrolides has been reported to increase the prevalence of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (MRSP), thereby leading to treatment failure in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. However, previous studies have demonstrated that several macrolides and lincosamides have beneficial effects on MRSP infection since they inhibit the production and release of pneumolysin, a pneumococcal pore-forming toxin released during autolysis. In this regard, we previously demonstrated that the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of pneumolysin release by erythromycin involved both the transcriptional downregulation of the gene encoding pneumolysin and the impairment of autolysis in MRSP. Here, using a cell supernatant of the culture, we have shown that clarithromycin inhibits pneumolysin release in MRSP. However, contrary to previous observations in erythromycin-treated MRSP, clarithromycin upregulated the transcription of the pneumococcal autolysis-related lytA gene and enhanced autolysis, leading to the leakage of pneumococcal DNA. On the other hand, compared to erythromycin, clarithromycin significantly downregulated the gene encoding pneumolysin. In a mouse model of MRSP pneumonia, the administration of both clarithromycin and erythromycin significantly decreased the pneumolysin protein level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and improved lung injury and arterial oxygen saturation without affecting bacterial load. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo data reinforce the benefits of macrolides on the clinical outcomes of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. IMPORTANCE Pneumolysin is a potent intracellular toxin possessing multiple functions that augment pneumococcal virulence. For over 10 years, sub-MICs of macrolides, including clarithromycin, have been recognized to decrease pneumolysin production and release from pneumococcal cells. However, this study indicates that macrolides significantly slowed pneumococcal growth, which may be related to decreased pneumolysin release recorded by previous studies. In this study, we demonstrated that clarithromycin decreases pneumolysin production through downregulation of ply gene transcription, regardless of its inhibitory activity against bacterial growth. Additionally, administration of clarithromycin resulted in the amelioration of lung injury in a mouse model of pneumonia induced by macrolide-resistant pneumococci. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of pneumolysin offers a good strategy to treat pneumococcal pneumonia."}

{"id": "pmid_12226800", "text": "Clinical relevance of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important respiratory tract pathogen in otitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia. Over the past decades, there has been an increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to penicillin. Decreased susceptibility to penicillin is not the same as penicillin resistance. Decreased susceptibility to penicillin has occurred worldwide from dissemination of several resistant pneumococcal clones, and, to a lesser extent, from excessive use of ciprofloxacin, macrolides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Currently, penicillin resistance is defined by using a breakpoint of 2 microg/mL or more. Intermediately resistant strains (MIC 1-2 microg/mL) are also relatively sensitive depending on antibiotic concentration. Intermediate antibiotic susceptibility is concentration dependent. Antibiotic concentration at various body sites is determined by pharmacokinetic considerations. Except for very highly resistant strains, the treatment of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae causing bacteremia, sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, or community-acquired pneumonia remains penicillin or any beta-lactam. Only in pneumococcal meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci does the clinician have to use care in selecting an antipneumococcal antibiotic with adequate cerebrospinal fluid penetration and favorable kill ratios. Clinicians should be selective in antibiotic selection to minimize further decreases in penicillin susceptibility to S. pneumoniae. This is best achieved by using low-resistance potential antibiotics oral/intravenous mono-therapy at the full recommended dose. Therapeutic failure may occur in using lower doses at certain body sites. Macro-lides as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy should be minimized. Optimal therapy for non-central nervous system pneumococcal infection is with a respiratory quinolone (eg, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), clindamycin, doxycycline, third-generation cephalosporins. For highly resistant pneumococci, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, cefepime, meropenem, vancomycin, or linezolid may be used."}

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens. The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease."}

Since the advent of the pneumococcal vaccine, cases of infective endocarditis (IE) from Streptococcus pneumoniae have become rare. Pneumococcal endocarditis (PE) may be the initial presentation in Austrian syndrome, which is very lethal. PE needs early detection and treatment and more commonly develops from pneumonia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PE caused by sinusitis after pneumococcal vaccination. Here, a 71-year-old male presented with low back pain and right ankle joint pain. He had no dental history or pneumonia and received a pneumococcal vaccine 2 years prior. Blood tests showed high inflammatory response. We suspected IE due to the high inflammatory response and oligoarthritis. Transthoracic echocardiography showed vegetation at the aortic valve. As IE was probable, empiric antibiotic therapy was promptly initiated. Blood cultures detected S. pneumoniae. IE was diagnosed based on Duke's diagnostic criteria. After starting antibiotic treatment, lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an abscess in the right erector spinae. Cranial MRI showed bilateral maxillary sinusitis. Sinusitis was considered the possible initial focus of infection. IE should be considered a differential in patients with S. pneumoniae detected in blood cultures without pneumonia even after pneumococcal vaccination as PE sometimes follows a fatal course. <Learning objective: Pneumococcal endocarditis (PE) is rare and can be fatal when there is diagnostic delay. It may be less likely to exhibit characteristic skin lesions of infective endocarditis (IE). Clinicians should include IE in the differential diagnoses for cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae detected in blood cultures without pneumonia. Transthoracic echocardiography is also useful for early detection and treatment of PE.>."}

We present the case of a pair of 16-month old African-American fraternal twins who presented to the emergency room on the same day for symptoms consistent with pneumonia. Upon further examination, the twins showed remarkably similar symptoms, and cultures revealed penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in both twins. The pneumonia affected both twins in the same way, but a tomography scan did not reveal any shared anatomical abnormalities to account for this near-identical progression. In a review of literature and case reports, there are no reported cases of fraternal twins with simultaneous or non-simultaneous pneumococcal pneumonia or effusions. This case suggests that there may be possible anatomical abnormalities in the fraternal twins which were not evident in routine testing that may have led to near-identical illnesses.

The 2007 CAP guidelines recommend routine use of the rapid pneumococcal urinary antigen (UAg) test. To assess the how pneumococcal UAg testing is being used among hospitalized adult CAP patients and what barriers restrict its use, a Web-based survey was distributed in 2013 to 1287 infectious disease physician members of the Emerging Infectious disease Network of the Infectious Disease Society of America. Of 493 eligible responses, 65% use the pneumococcal UAg test. The primary barrier to UAg use was availability (46%). UAg users reported ordering fewer other diagnostic tests and tailoring antibiotic therapy. Increased access to UAg tests could improve pneumonia management and pneumococcal CAP surveillance."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of human infectious diseases worldwide. Despite this documented evidence, data on pneumococcal disease rates among general populations are scant because of the frequent lack of cultural identification. In this study we propose a model for estimating the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia on hospitalizations. The study was performed by analyzing administrative and clinical data of patients aged 50 years or older, resident in Sicily, and hospitalized, from 2005 to 2012. Demographic information, admission/discharge dates, discharge status, and up to 6 discharge diagnoses coded according to ICD-9 CM were collected for each hospitalized patient. During the 8-year study period, a total of 72,372 hospitalizations with at least one ICD-9 CM diagnosis code suggestive of all-cause pneumonia were recorded. Of these, 1943 (2.7%) hospitalizations had specific ICD-9 CM diagnosis codes for pneumococcal pneumonia. According to the proposed model, 16,541 (22.9%) pneumonia out of all-cause pneumonia was estimated to be attributable to S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal pneumonia and model-estimated pneumococcal pneumonia had mean hospitalization rates of 13.4 and 113.3/100,000, respectively, with a decreasing temporal trend. The risk of hospitalization for pneumococcal pneumonia was strongly correlated with age (P<0.001). Our model provides data usable to construct suitable decisional models for the decision-makers and could allow to the responsibles of healthcare facilities to assess the budget impact if they hypothesize to offer vaccination for pneumococcal disease to certain cohorts of subjects aged 50 years or older. In our area, the high estimated hospitalization rates among adults aged ≥65 years suggest the need to implement effective preventive strategies (e.g., vaccination) tailored for these groups."}

The distribution of subtypes did not differ between elderly adults (over 65) and younger adults (under 65). The GMCs of IgG antibodies to PPS were significantly lower in males than in females for types 7f, 18c and 19a.

This study compared patients hospitalized with CAP caused by M. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae aiming at increasing the understanding of when to sample for and empirically treat M. pneumoniae. From 2016 to 2018, 518 adults hospitalized with CAP were prospectively and consecutively enrolled. Medical history, symptoms, radiographic, and laboratory data were recorded. Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for PCR detection of M. pneumoniae and other respiratory pathogens, while urine samples were analysed with two pneumococcal urinary antigens. A total of 32 patients with M. pneumoniae and 126 patients with S. pneumoniae were identified. Patients with M. pneumoniae were significantly younger than those with pneumococcal CAP with a median age 39 versus 70 years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounted for only 6% of CAP cases across all ages, but for 33% of cases in patients < 50 years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae patients had a longer duration of symptoms and were more often prescribed antibiotics prior to hospital admission. Neither symptoms nor chest imaging alone could distinguish between M. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae. Although inflammatory markers such as CRP and leukocyte counts were significantly lower in M. pneumoniae CAP, the median CRP value was still elevated at 178 mg/L. Viral co-detection occurred in 14% of M. pneumoniae patients, compared to 42% of those with S. pneumoniae.

{"id": "pmid_30246592", "text": "Induction of the pneumococcal vncRS operon by lactoferrin is essential for pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), the major pathogen for pneumonia, commonly colonizes the lung, but the mechanism underlying the coordination of virulence factors during invasion via the host protein remains poorly understood. Bacterial lysis releases the components of the cell wall, and triggers innate immunity and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Previously, the virulence of the pep27 mutant was shown to be attenuated as a feasible candidate for vaccine development. However, the role of pep27 gene, belonging to the vancomycin-resistance locus (vncRS operon), in virulence, is largely unknown. This study demonstrates that transferrin in the host serum reduces the survival of the host during S. pneumoniae infections in mice. The exposure of the pneumococcal D39 strain to lactoferrin induced the vncRS operon, lysis, and subsequent in vivo cytokine production, resulting in lung inflammation. However, these responses were significantly attenuated in pneumococci harboring a mutation in pep27. Mechanistically, the VncS ligand, identified as lactoferrin, induced the vncRS operon and increased the in vivo mortality rates. Thus, serum-induced activation of vncRS plays an essential role in inducing pneumonia."}

Pneumonia is a common respiratory infection affecting individuals of all ages, with a significantly higher incidence among the elderly. As the aging population grows, pneumonia is expected to become an increasingly critical health concern. In non-institutionalized elderly individuals, the annual incidence ranges from 25 to 44 per 1000, approximately four times higher than in those under 65. Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive diplococcus, is the leading cause of pneumonia-related deaths in older adults. Management of S. pneumoniae infections in the elderly is challenging due to impaired antibody responses to polysaccharides and surface proteins, compounded by rising antibiotic resistance. The underlying mechanisms for increased susceptibility remain unclear, but age-related changes in the immune system, particularly in dendritic cells and T cells, are implicated. This review explores how aging-related immune alterations contribute to the heightened vulnerability of the elderly to S. pneumoniae infections."}

This study assessed changes in Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype distribution and antimicrobial nonsusceptibility among hospitalized children with pneumonia in Shenzhen, China, from 2009 to 2019, under low pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) coverage. We analyzed 1,361 isolates (62 invasive, 1,299 noninvasive). Serotypes were identified by latex agglutination and Quellung reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using E-test, and vaccination data were obtained from the local CDC. PCV13 serotype coverage remained high among invasive isolates (96.8%) and represented a substantial proportion of all isolates. A marked decline in serotype 19F (from 59.2% to 14.4%) and increased serotype diversity (from 14 to 26 types) were observed. Non-susceptible rates to four beta-lactam antibiotics decreased from 16.0% to 2.4%, largely due to the decline of serotype 19F. PCV vaccination rates rose to 31.1% by 2019. Non-vaccine serotypes increased over time, with some (e.g. 15B/C) showing elevated beta-lactam MICs. Despite low vaccination rate, PCV13 serotypes remained predominant among isolates. The decline of serotype 19F and reduced beta-lactam nonsusceptibility suggest vaccine impact. Rising serotype diversity and the emergence of nonsusceptible non-vaccine types highlight the need for continued surveillance."}

Studies have shown that antibiotics in nanocarriers may lead to increased antibacterial activity and reduced toxicity. The aim of this work was to valuate in vitro antibacterial performance azithromycin-Eudragit RS100 nano-formulations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Methods: AZI-Eudragit RS100 nanoparticles were prepared via electrospinning technique and the in vitro antibacterial performance against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus were assessed using agar dilution method. Results: Nanofibers in the sizes about 100-300 nm in diameter and micro scale in length and nanobeads in the range of 100-500 nm were achieved. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) showed an enhancement in the antimicrobial effect of AZI-Eudragit RS100 nanofibers (40 µg/ml) compare to untreated AZI solution (>160 µg/ml) against S. pneumonia. The MIC value for AZI-Eudragit RS100 nanofibers against S. aureus was >128 µg/ml, same as that of the untreated AZI solution. Conclusion: The enhanced efficiency of AZI in nanofibers could be related to the more adsorption opportunity of nanofibers to S. pneumonia capsulated cell wall which provides an antibiotic depot on the bacterial surface compared to S. aureus. AZI-Eudragit RS100 nanofibers with enhanced antimicrobial effect against S. pneumonia can be considered as a candidate for in vivo evaluations in antibiotic therapy of Pneumococcal infections."}

In recent decades, the increase of S. pneumoniae strains' resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and other classes of antimicrobials has made treatment even more complicated. Fortunately, the advent of heptavalent conjugate vaccine confers a high degree of protection against pneumococcal disease and colonization caused by vaccine serotype strains. After the introduction of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes and antibiotic-resistant isolates has been reduced.

Conjugation of capsular polysaccharides with a highly immunogenic protein, i.e. a non-toxic diphtheria toxoid, induces a B- and T-cell response resulting in mucosal immunity and thus effectively protects against vaccine serotypes that induce invasive pneumococcal disease, thereby at the same time reducing vaccine serotype carrier rates. Pronounced herd immunity resulted in a decrease in invasive pneumococcal diseases in vaccinees and non-vaccinees as well as reduced antibiotic resistance rates. However, recent studies report that serotypes eradicated by the vaccine are being replaced by non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes. This so-called 'replacement' might soon threaten the success of vaccine use."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common microbial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Currently, there are no available models of severe pneumococcal pneumonia in mechanically ventilated animals to mimic clinical conditions of critically ill patients. We studied endogenous pulmonary flora in 4 healthy pigs and in an additional 10 pigs in which we intra-bronchially instilled S. pneumoniae serotype 19 A, characterized by its resistance to penicillin, macrolides and tetracyclines. The pigs underwent ventilation for 72 h. All pigs that were not challenged with S. pneumoniae completed the 72-h study, whereas 30% of infected pigs did not. At 24 h, we clinically confirmed pneumonia in the infected pigs; upon necropsy, we sampled lung tissue for microbiological/histological confirmation of pneumococcal pneumonia. In control pigs, Streptococcus suis and Staphylococcus aureus were the most commonly encountered pathogens, and their lung tissue mean ± s.e.m. concentration was 7.94 ± 20 c.f.u./g. In infected pigs, S. pneumoniae was found in the lungs of all pigs (mean ± s.e.m. pulmonary concentration of 1.26 × 105 ± 2 × 102 c.f.u./g). Bacteremia was found in 50% of infected pigs. Pneumococcal pneumonia was confirmed in all infected pigs at 24 h. Pneumonia was associated with thrombocytopenia, an increase in prothrombin time, cardiac output and vasopressor dependency index and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Upon necropsy, microbiological/histological pneumococcal pneumonia was confirmed in 8 of 10 pigs. We have therefore developed a novel model of penicillin- and macrolide-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia in mechanically ventilated pigs with bacteremia and severe hemodynamic compromise. The model could prove valuable for appraising the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia, the effects associated with macrolide resistance and the outcomes related to the use of new diagnostic strategies and antibiotic or complementary therapies."}

Pneumococcal pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The inflammatory response to bacteria is necessary to control infection, but it may also contribute to tissue damage. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, such as rolipram (ROL), effectively reduce inflammation. Here, we examined the impact of ROL in a pneumococcal pneumonia murine model. Mice were infected intranasally with 10(5)-10(6) CFU of Streptococcus pneumoniae, treated with ROL in a prophylactic or therapeutic schedule in combination, or not, with the antibiotic ceftriaxone. Inflammation and bacteria counts were assessed, and ex vivo phagocytosis assays were performed. ROL treatment during S. pneumoniae infection decreased neutrophil recruitment into lungs and airways and reduced lung injury. Prophylactic ROL treatment also decreased cytokine levels in the airways. Although modulation of inflammation by ROL ameliorated pneumonia, bacteria burden was not reduced. On the other hand, antibiotic therapy reduced bacteria without reducing neutrophil infiltration, cytokine level, or lung injury. Combined ROL and ceftriaxone treatment decreased lethality rates and was more efficient in reducing inflammation, by increasing proresolving protein annexin A1 (AnxA1) expression, and bacterial burden by enhancing phagocytosis. Lack of AnxA1 increased inflammation and lethality induced by pneumococcal infection. These data show that immunomodulatory effects of phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors are useful during severe pneumococcal pneumonia and suggest their potential benefit as adjunctive therapy during infectious diseases."}

We investigated whether streamlining in bacteraemic pneumococcal infections is associated with mortality. Adults admitted to two Dutch hospitals between 2001 and 2011 with bacteraemic pneumococcal infections were retrospectively included. Detailed clinical data on patient characteristics, comorbidities and severity and outcome of disease were obtained in addition to data on antibiotic treatment. Those eligible for streamlining were selected for further analyses. In the 45.8% of cases (126 of 275) where antibiotic treatment was streamlined, a lower mortality rate was observed (6.3% versus 15.4%, P = 0.021). The decision to streamline was only marginally explained by the 38 determinants accounted for.

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of lung colonization, as well acute pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jiroveci, and has been documented to produce significant depression of the phagocytic function of alveolar macrophages in HIV-infected patients, which may underlie this risk. Legionella pneumophila infections appear to be uncommon in HIV-infected patients, while pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to occur with regularity, including infections with antibiotic-resistant isolates. Pneumocystis pneumonia occurs with a low incidence in patients receiving HAART, once the CD4 count increases to over 200 microl.

There have been no reports of the detection of S. pneumoniae antigen in lung lavage fluid. An elderly male patient with suboptimal fasting blood glucose control and a history of liver abscess. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed inflammatory lesions in both lungs with consolidation in the middle lobe of the right lung. After admission, we collected alveolar lavage fluid in a timely manner and performed pneumococcal antigen detection and etiological testing. Prompt testing for pneumococcal antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid yielded a positive clinical outcome. Subsequent analysis via bacterial culture of sputum and next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of BALF definitively identified S. pneumoniae as the etiological agent. Following the analysis of drug sensitivity test results from the identified pathogens, adjustments were made to the antibiotic regimen, and appropriate pus puncture drainage was performed. Subsequently, the patient's condition improved, leading to discharge. The identification of S. pneumoniae antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may facilitate earlier and more precise diagnosis of pneumonia attributed to S. pneumoniae."}

The new generation of organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells holds a promising strategy for modeling host-bacteria interaction studies. Organoids recapitulate the composition, diversity of cell types, and, to some extent, the functional features of the native organ. We generated lung bud organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells to study the interaction of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) with the alveolar epithelium. Invasive pneumococcal disease is an important health problem that may occur as a result of the spread of pneumococcus from the lower respiratory tract to sterile sites. We show here an efficient experimental approach to model the main events of the pneumococcal infection that occur in the human lung, exploring bacterial adherence to the epithelium and internalization and triggering an innate response that includes the interaction with surfactant and the expression of representative cytokines and chemokines. Thus, this model, based on human minilungs, can be used to study pneumococcal virulence factors and the pathogenesis of different serotypes, and it will allow therapeutic interventions in a reliable human context. IMPORTANCE Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for high morbidity and mortalities rates worldwide, affecting mainly children and adults older than 65 years. Pneumococcus is also the most common etiologic agent of bacterial pneumonia and nonepidemic meningitis, and it is a frequent cause of bacterial sepsis. Although the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines has decreased the burden of pneumococcal disease, the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains and nonvaccine types by serotype replacement is worrisome. To study the biology of pneumococcus and to establish a reliable human model for pneumococcal pathogenesis, we generated human minilungs from embryonic stem cells. The results show that these organoids can be used to model some events occurring during the interaction of pneumococcus with the lung, such as adherence, internalization, and the initial alveolar innate response. This model also represents a great alternative for studying virulence factors involved in pneumonia, drug screening, and other therapeutic interventions."}

The pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) is a common bacterial pathogen responsible for various infections, especially in children below 5 years of age. The severity of pneumococcal infections varies from self-limiting mucosal infections, including acute otitis media, sinusitis, and noninvasive pneumonia, to life-threatening invasive disease like bacteremia and meningitis. A high incidence of pneumococcal infections is combined with a constantly growing antibiotic resistance of this pathogen. The growing resistance is thought to be associated with misuse of antibiotics and emerging of resistant clones that may spread throughout the entire population. Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (PCV) contain an assortment of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (from 7 to 13) that produce serotype-specific protective antibodies.

We derived estimates of healthcare utilization and cost (in 2012 dollars) attributable to penicillin, erythromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance by taking the estimate of disease burden from a previously described decision tree model of pneumococcal pneumonia in the U.S. We analyzed model outputs assuming only the existence of susceptible strains and calculating the resulting differences in cost and utilization. We modeled the cost of resistance from delayed resolution of illness and the resulting additional health services. Our model estimated that non-susceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin and fluoroquinolones directly caused 32,398 additional outpatient visits and 19,336 hospitalizations for pneumococcal pneumonia. The incremental cost of antibiotic resistance was estimated to account for 4% ($91 million) of direct medical costs and 5% ($233 million) of total costs including work and productivity loss. Most of the incremental medical cost ($82 million) was related to hospitalizations resulting from erythromycin non-susceptibility. Among patients under age 18 years, erythromycin non-susceptibility was estimated to cause 17% of hospitalizations for pneumonia and $38 million in costs, or 39% of pneumococcal pneumonia costs attributable to resistance.

Evidence is accumulating that exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) increases the risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia, which in turn is the leading cause of ARDS. Chronic smokers have increased rates of pneumococcal colonization and develop more severe pneumococcal pneumonia than nonsmokers; yet mechanistic connections between CS exposure, bacterial pneumonia, and ARDS pathogenesis remain relatively unexplored. We exposed mice to 3 wk of moderate whole body CS or air, followed by intranasal inoculation with an invasive serotype of S. pneumoniae. CS exposure alone caused no detectable lung injury or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) inflammation. During pneumococcal infection, CS-exposed mice had greater survival than air-exposed mice, in association with reduced systemic spread of bacteria from the lungs. However, when mice were treated with antibiotics after infection to improve clinical relevance, the survival benefit was lost, and CS-exposed mice had more pulmonary edema, increased numbers of BAL monocytes, and elevated monocyte and lymphocyte chemokines. CS-exposed antibiotic-treated mice also had higher serum surfactant protein D and angiopoietin-2, consistent with more severe lung epithelial and endothelial injury. The results indicate that acute CS exposure enhances the recruitment of immune cells to the lung during bacterial pneumonia, an effect that may provide microbiological benefit but simultaneously exposes the mice to more severe inflammatory lung injury. The inclusion of antibiotic treatment in preclinical studies of acute lung injury in bacterial pneumonia may enhance clinical relevance, particularly for future studies of current or emerging tobacco products."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading bacterial cause of a wide range of infections, and pneumococcal pneumosepsis causes high mortality in hosts infected with antibiotic-resistant strains and those who cannot resolve ongoing inflammation. The factors which influence the development and outcome of pneumosepsis are currently unclear. IL-6 is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis, and we determined that this cytokine is also essential for resisting pneumosepsis, as it inhibits macrophage pyroptosis and pyroptosis-related inflammation injury in the lung. IL-6 affected infection outcomes in mice and exerted a protective role, primarily via macrophages. We further found that IL-6 deficiency led to increased lung macrophage death and aggravated lung inflammation, and that exogenous administration of IL-6 protein could decrease macrophage death and alleviate lung tissue inflammation. IL-6 also protected Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced lung macrophage death and lung inflammation injury by inhibiting gasdermin E (GSDME)- and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism for the development of pneumosepsis and the critical protective role of IL-6. These findings may assist in the early identification and treatment of pneumococcal pneumosepsis. IMPORTANCE Pneumococcal pneumonia has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout human history. Failing to control pneumococcal pneumonia and resolve ongoing inflammation in a host can cause sepsis, namely pneumococcal pneumosepsis, and death ensues. Few theories have suggested an optimally therapeutic option for this infectious disease. The interleukin-6 (IL-6, a cytokine featuring pleiotropic activity) theory, proposed here, implies that IL-6 acts as a protector against pneumococcal pneumosepsis. IL-6 prevents lung macrophage death and lung inflammation injury by inhibiting a caspase-3-GSDME-mediated switch from apoptosis to pyroptosis and inhibiting caspase-1-GSDMD-mediated classic pyroptosis during pneumococcal pneumosepsis. Thus, IL-6 is an important determinant for controlling bacterial invasion and a homeostatic coordinator of pneumococcal pneumosepsis. This study clarifies a novel mechanism of occurrence and development of pneumonia and secondary sepsis following a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. It is important for the early identification and treatment of pneumococcal pneumosepsis."}

Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced to Japan in 2010. We investigated the impact of PCV7 on childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and pneumococcal pneumonia (PP). Children aged <5 years living in Chiba city, Japan, who were admitted to hospitals were enrolled to estimate the incidence of CAP based on the mid-year population. PP was determined by the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in cultured blood and/or sputum samples of CAP patients. The incidence of CAP and S. pneumoniae isolated from PP patients was compared before (April 2008-March 2009) and after (April 2012-March 2013) the introduction of PCV7 immunization. The annual incidence of CAP was reduced [incidence rate ratio 0·81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·73-0·90]. When comparing post-vaccine with pre-vaccine periods, the odds ratio for PP incidence was 0·60 (95% CI 0·39-0·93, P = 0·024). PCV7-covered serotypes markedly decreased (66·6% in pre-vaccine vs. 15·6% in post-vaccine, P < 0·01), and serotypes 6C, 15A, 15C and 19A increased. Multidrug-resistant international clones in the pre-vaccine period (Spain6B-2/ST90, Taiwan19F-14/ST236) decreased, while Sweden15A-25/ST63 was the dominant clone in the post-vaccine period. A significant reduction in the incidence of both CAP hospitalizations and culture-confirmed PP of vaccine serotypes was observed at 2 years after PCV7 vaccination."}

Pneumococcal carriage is considered to be an important source of horizontal spread of this pathogen within the community. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is capable of inducing serotype-specific antibodies in sera of infants, and has been suggested to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci in children. PCV is generally immunogenic for pediatric patients with invasive pneumococcal disease, with an exception for the infecting serotypes. Based on evidences from the clinical trials of PCV, the health impact of childhood pneumococcal pneumonia appears to be high in developing countries where most of global childhood pneumonia deaths occur. PCV vaccination may prevent hundreds of deaths per 100,000 children vaccinated in developing countries, while PCV vaccination is expected to prevent less than 10 deaths per 100,000 children vaccinated in the developed countries. Therefore, the WHO has proposed a strategy to reduce the incidence of severe pneumonia by 75% in child less than 5 years of age compared to 2010 levels by 2025."}

Readily-available diagnostics do not reliably discriminate between viral and bacterial pediatric uncomplicated pneumonia, both of which are common. Some have suggested that assessment of pneumococcal carriage could be used to identify those children with bacterial pneumonia. The objective of this study was to determine if nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization patterns differed between children with definite viral disease, definite bacterial disease, and respiratory disease of indeterminate etiology. Three groups of subjects were recruited: children with critical respiratory illness, previously healthy children with respiratory illness admitted to the ward, and previously healthy children diagnosed in the emergency department with non-severe pneumonia. Subjects were categorized as follows: a) viral infection syndrome (eg. bronchiolitis), b) bacterial infection syndrome (ie. pneumonia complicated by effusion/empyema), or c) 'indeterminate' pneumonia. Subjects' nasopharyngeal swabs underwent quantitative PCR testing for S. pneumoniae. Associations between categorical variables were determined with Fisher's exact, chi-square, or logistic regression, as appropriate. Associations between quantitative genomic load and categorical variables was determined by linear regression. There were 206 children in Group 1, 122 children in Group 2, and 179 children in Group 3. Only a minority (227/507, 45%) had detectable pneumococcal carriage; in those subjects, there was no association of quantitative genomic load with age, recruitment group, or disease category. In multivariate logistic regression, pneumococcal colonization > 3 log copies/mL was associated with younger age and recruitment group, but not with disease category. The nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae colonization patterns of subjects with definite viral infection were very similar to colonization patterns of those with definite bacterial infection or indeterminate pneumonia. Assessment and quantification of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization does not therefore appear useful to discriminate between acute viral and bacterial respiratory disease; consequently, this diagnostic testing is unlikely to reliably determine which children with indeterminate pneumonia have a bacterial etiology and/or require antibiotic treatment."}

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are highly effective in preventing invasive disease in infants and young children, with favorable safety and immunogenicity profiles. These pediatric vaccines have also shown efficacy in reducing cases of non-invasive disease (i.e. otitis media, pneumonia). Recently, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have demonstrated additional protective qualities that may enhance their use worldwide. For example, they can reduce nasopharyngeal acquisition of vaccine-specific serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which may in turn reduce the incidence of pneumococcal disease among non-vaccinated individuals; this is termed indirect or herd immunity. Although the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains has complicated disease management, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been shown to protect against pneumococcal disease caused by such strains because most antibiotic-resistant strains are of the serotypes included in these vaccines. Thus, widespread use of these conjugate vaccines may prevent disease by providing both direct and indirect immunity, and may reduce the use of antibiotics and the development of antibiotic resistance worldwide."}

Although the Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum are considered standard methods for the diagnosis of presumptive pneumococcal pneumonia, these methods remain relatively insensitive and nonspecific. We developed an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the quantitation of pneumococcal C polysaccharide (PnC) in the sputum of patients with presumptive pneumococcal pneumonia. Of 34 patient sputum samples collected within 24 h of the first radiographic report of pneumonia, 12 grew Streptococcus pneumoniae on culture. By using a cutoff point of 0.5 micrograms of PnC per ml of sputum, all 12 specimens were positive (sensitivity, 100%) by EIA. PnC levels ranged from 1.43 to 57.53 micrograms/ml. Blood samples from 18 of the 34 patients were cultured. S. pneumoniae grew in the culture of a blood sample from one patient, whose sputum also had the highest PnC level. Of 22 sputum samples from patients with pneumonia that did not grow S. pneumonia, two were positive by EIA (specificity, 90.1%). Sputa from both patients had low levels of PnC (2.7 and 4.5 micrograms/ml), and both patients had received antibiotics before sputum collection. The positive predictive value of the quantitative EIA was 85.7%. Quantitation of PnC has the potential for improving the accuracy of sputum examination for S. pneumoniae, monitoring disease severity and the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, and differentiating between those patients with invasive pneumococcal disease and those who are carriers of S. pneumoniae."}

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common and potentially serious illness that is associated with morbidity and mortality. Although medical care has improved during the past decades, it is still potentially lethal. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent microorganism isolated. Treatment includes mandatory antibiotic therapy and organ support as needed. There are several antibiotic therapy regimens that include β-lactams or macrolides or fluoroquinolones alone or in combination. Combination antibiotic therapy achieves a better outcome compared with monotherapy and it should be given in the following subset of patients with CAP: outpatients with comorbidities and previous antibiotic therapy, nursing home patients with CAP, hospitalized patients with severe CAP, bacteremic pneumococcal CAP, presence of shock, and necessity of mechanical ventilation. Better outcome is associated with combination therapy that includes a macrolide for wide coverage of atypical pneumonia, polymicrobial pneumonia, or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrolides have shown different properties other than antimicrobial activity, such as anti-inflammatory properties. Although this evidence comes from observational, most of them retrospective and nonblinded studies, the findings are consistent.

Mice vaccinated with either commercial conjugate or purified polysaccharide vaccines had impaired antibody responses if they were chronically infected with Taenia crassiceps. This translated to increased susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia and high mortality compared to helminth-negative vaccinated animals, which were fully protected from disease and death. Antibodies taken from Taenia-infected, vaccinated mice were unable to effectively opsonize S. pneumoniae for killing by alveolar macrophages, and did not protect against pneumococcal challenge when adoptively transferred into naïve animals. These data may have implications for vaccination programs in countries endemic with helminths."}

The rate of in vitro bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is escalating among pathogens that cause the most serious respiratory tract infections.

In particular, resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy has assumed a prominent role in the evolution of guidelines for the initial treatment of respiratory tract infection. I conducted a critical review of the published medical literature. There is only a single report of documented microbiologic failure of parenteral penicillin-class antibiotics in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia in patients with or without bacteremia, whereas there are numerous well-documented reports of treatment failure with quinolone-class (n > or = 21) and macrolide-class (n > or = 33) antibiotics in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia. The recommended optimal in-hospital therapy for community-acquired pneumonia should continue to be a beta-lactam antibiotic (penicillin, aminopenicillin, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) administered with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone agent for adjunctive treatment of infection with potential atypical pathogens."}

From October 2007 to March 2008, we prospectively evaluated 541 consecutive inpatients for whom the ICT was performed in our institution. Of the 541 patients evaluated, only 233 (43%) were suspected by the treating physicians to have a pneumonia, 58 of whom had a positive ICT result. Among these 58 patients, four (7%) and 26 (45%), respectively, were treated with amoxycillin monotherapy before and after the ICT result had been obtained (p <10(-4)). Although a positive ICT result led to a rise in the proportion of patients treated with amoxycillin alone, a large number continued to be treated with broader-spectrum antibiotics. These results suggest that prescription monitoring of the ICT should be implemented along with encouragement to adhere more strictly to treatment guidelines."}

There was a 45% and 41% reduction in CAP hospitalisation rates, between the pre-PCV7 and PCV13 periods, respectively. Significant reductions occurred in the proportion of CAP due to PP and PCV13 serotypes. Conversely, no change occurred in the proportion of CAP caused by H. influenzae. The incidence of hospitalised CAP in children aged ⩽15 years was significantly reduced after the introduction of PCV13 in Japan.

The results were compared with those from conventional microbiological studies. Three hundred and forty-nine adult patients with CAP who were admitted to the hospital were studied prospectively between February 2001 and January 2004. The ICT test was positive in 115 (33.0%) of 349 patients enrolled into the study and in 63 (75.9%) of 83 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia confirmed by conventional methods. The test revealed a sensitivity of 75.9% and a specificity of 94.0% with conventional microbiological criteria used as the reference standard. The positive predictive value was 91.3%, and the negative predictive value was 82.6%. The clinical features of 53 patients in whom ICT was positive and no pathogen was identified showed no significant difference from those of 83 patients who had pneumococcal pneumonia identified by conventional methods. The diagnostic yield of pneumococcal pneumonia was increased up to 38.9% using ICT combined with conventional methods. The Binax NOW ICT to detect S. pneumoniae urinary antigen is therefore a rapid and useful method for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major causative agent in community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis. Overwhelming lung inflammation during pneumococcal pneumonia may hamper lung function. Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a key signaling protein controlling the activation of various immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils. The aim of this study was to determine whether ibrutinib treatment ameliorates acute lung inflammation during pneumococcal pneumonia. Mice were treated orally with ibrutinib and the effect on acute pulmonary inflammation elicited by the gram-positive bacterial cell wall component lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and during ceftriaxone-treated pneumococcal pneumonia was assessed. Treatment with ibrutinib prior to and after intranasal LTA instillation reduced alveolar macrophage activation, neutrophil influx, cytokine release and plasma leakage into the lung. Postponed treatment with ibrutinib supplementing antibiotic therapy during ongoing pneumococcal pneumonia did not impair bacterial killing in lung, blood and spleen. In this setting, ibrutinib reduced alveolar macrophage and systemic neutrophil activation and substantially diminished further monocyte and neutrophil influx in the lung. In vitro, ibrutinib inhibited macrophage TNF secretion and neutrophil activation upon LTA and pneumococcal stimulation. Taken together, these data indicate that the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib reduces inflammatory myeloid cell responses during acute pulmonary inflammation evoked by LTA and antibiotic-treated pneumococcal pneumonia and suggest that ibrutinib has the potential to inhibit ongoing lung inflammation in an acute infectious setting."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is the etiologic agent of community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal diseases such as septicemia and bacterial meningitis. The increasing antibiotic resistance and the suboptimal efficacy or limited serotype coverage of currently available vaccines urgently requires novel approaches in exploring new antimicrobials, therapeutic intervention strategies and vaccines. The current vaccine development strategies rely on the hypothesis that surface-exposed proteins, which are essential for pneumococcal virulence, are the most suitable candidates for future protein-based vaccines. Since virulence is closely linked with bacterial fitness, the potential of a pathogen to colonize and infect the host depends further on its physiology. This review summarizes the application of genome-wide techniques and their exploitation to decipher fundamental insights into bacterial factors associated with fitness, metabolism and virulence, leading to the discovery of vaccine candidates or antimicrobials."}

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia leading to high mortality rates. Inflammation triggered by pneumococcal infection is necessary for bacterial clearance but must be spatially and temporally regulated to prevent further tissue damage and bacterial dissemination. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) mainly acts through Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 (FPR2) inducing the resolution of inflammation. Here, we have evaluated the role of AnxA1 and FPR2 during pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. For that, AnxA1, Fpr2/3 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) controls were infected intranasally with S pneumoniae. AnxA1 and Fpr2/3 KO mice were highly susceptible to infection, displaying uncontrolled inflammation, increased bacterial dissemination, and pulmonary dysfunction compared to WT animals. Mechanistically, the absence of AnxA1 resulted in the loss of lung barrier integrity and increased neutrophil activation upon S pneumoniae stimulation. Importantly, treatment of WT or AnxA1 KO-infected mice with Ac2-26 decreased inflammation, lung damage, and bacterial burden in the airways by increasing macrophage phagocytosis. Conversely, Ac2-26 peptide was ineffective to afford protection in Fpr2/3 KO mice during infection. Altogether, these findings show that AnxA1, via FPR2, controls inflammation and bacterial dissemination during pneumococcal pneumonia by promoting host defenses, suggesting AnxA1-based peptides as a novel therapeutic strategy to control pneumococcal pneumonia."}

Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children in developing countries and is also the leading infectious cause of death in adults. The most important cause of pneumonia is the Gram-positive bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, also known as the pneumococcus. It has thus become the leading vaccine-preventable cause of death and is a successful and diverse human pathogen. The development of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines has made possible the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants, but has also elucidated aspects of pneumococcal biology in a number of ways. Use of the vaccine as a probe has increased our understanding of the burden of pneumococcal disease in children globally. Vaccination has also elucidated the clinical spectrum of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal infections; the identification of a biological niche for multiple pneumococcal serotypes in carriage and the differential invasiveness of pneumococcal serotypes; the impact of pneumococcal transmission among children on disease burden in adults; the role of carriage as a precursor to pneumonia; the plasticity of a naturally transformable pathogen to respond to selective pressure through capsular switching and the accumulation of antibiotic-resistance determinants; and the role of pneumococcal infections in hospitalization and mortality associated with respiratory viral infections, including both seasonal and pandemic influenza.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) causes multiple infectious diseases. The pneumococcal competence system facilitates genetic transformation, spreads antibiotic resistance, and contributes to virulence. DNA-processing protein A (DprA) regulates the exit of pneumococcus from the competent state. Previously, we have shown that DprA is important in both bacteremia and pneumonia infections. Here, we examined the mechanisms of virulence attenuation in a ΔdprA mutant. Compared to the parental wild-type D39, the ΔdprA mutant enters the competent state when exposed to lower concentrations of the competence-stimulating peptide CSP1. The ΔdprA mutant overexpresses ComM, which delays cell separation after division. Additionally, the ΔdprA mutant overexpresses allolytic factors LytA, CbpD, and CibAB and is more susceptible to detergent-triggered lysis. Disabling of the competent-state-specific induction of ComM and allolytic factors compensated for the virulence loss in the ΔdprA mutant, suggesting that overexpression of these factors contributes to virulence attenuation. Finally, the ΔdprA mutant fails to downregulate the expression of multiple competence-regulated genes, leading to the excessive energy consumption. Collectively, these results indicate that an inability to properly exit the competent state disrupts multiple cellular processes that cause virulence attenuation in the ΔdprA mutant."}
